    <p>“A room without books is like a body without a soul.”
        <br>
        <br>"African Redemption" is an extremely powerful story of a young Southern African, from his late high school
        days through three years of college to his life in Harlem. His early training preparedhim for a life of humility
        before white men, but through injustices- large and small, he came to realize that he wasan "invisible man".
        People saw in him only a reflection oftheir preconceived ideas of what he was, denied his individuality,and
        ultimately did not see him at all. This theme, which has implications far beyond the obvious racial parallel, is
        skillfully handled. The incidents of the story are wholly absorbing.

    <p>“Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”
        <br>
        <br>Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of "My truths". It completely blew my mind. It
        managed to surpass my high expectations and be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak "Double Plus
        Good." Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't
        help it. My mind is completely fried.

    <p>“Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
        <br>
        <br>Three-quarters of the way through Lisa Halliday's debut novel,"Asymmetry", a British foreign correspondent
        named Alistair is spending Christmas on a compound outside of Baghdad. His fellow revelers include camera men,
        defense contractors, United Nations employees and aid workers. Best Book.
